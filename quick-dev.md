# ðŸš€ Quick Development Solution

Since we're having local server networking issues (possibly firewall/macOS security), here are **two working alternatives**:

## Option 1: Direct Logic Testing (Fastest)

Test your API logic directly without a server:

```bash
node test-api.js
```

This runs your birthday reminder logic with full debugging and shows exactly what's happening.

## Option 2: Use Railway for Testing (Current Working Solution)

Since Railway works and deploys in 30 seconds (not 5 minutes), use it for testing:

```bash
# Make changes to your code
git add -A
git commit -m "test birthday logic fix"
git push origin main

# Test at: https://propertylinkpro-production.up.railway.app/api/reminders/birthdays
```

## âœ… Current Status

**The birthday reminder logic is working correctly!** 

The test shows:
- John Doe (July 25) âœ… Found
- Jane Smith (July 9) âœ… Found
- Both correctly identified for July

## Next Steps

1. **For debugging:** Use `node test-api.js` to test logic changes instantly
2. **For full testing:** Push to Railway and test the actual API
3. **For production:** The current Railway deployment should work

## Why Local Server Isn't Working

Likely causes:
- macOS firewall blocking localhost connections
- Network security settings
- VPN or corporate network restrictions
- Port conflicts with system services

But since the logic testing works and Railway works, you have everything you need for development!
